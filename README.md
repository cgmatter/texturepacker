# Texture Packer

Texture Packer is a Python program that takes PNG images generated by Shoebox from https://renderhjs.net/shoebox/ and packs them all into one texture atlas PNG with very little waste.

## How it Works

The program uses the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and OpenCV to process the images. It first loads the images and adds an alpha channel if it doesn't exist. Then, it checks if the image is fully opaque. If it is, it treats the entire image as a single rectangle. Otherwise, it converts the image to grayscale and applies a binary threshold to find contours.

The program also calculates the percentage of transparency remaining in the output image and the average transparency of the source image(s)
 
## Usage

To use the program, you need to have Python installed on your machine along with the necessary libraries (numpy, PIL, tkinter, cv2, and os). Once you have these, you can run the program with your images as input.

## Future Work

The current version of the program only supports one type of packing algorithm. More packing methods exist. You can search for strip packing algorithms.
I'd love to impliment a toggle to allow for textures to be rotated for best fit.
Each independant check can be run in it's own thread, and output their fit and image. This would wildly speed up the dynamic fit biasing, but I was afraid it might mess up the exe.
The loading bar only updates with the progress of the first scale check. I don't care enough to fix.
