# Heyo!

This is a repo for a bunch of **"Texture Atlases"** (basically an optimally packed grid of images)

Feel free to download and use in your projects (<i>commercial is fine</i>) - if you can credit that's great! but also not mandatory

To make these I...
* took some photos out and about
* used shoebox [texture ripper](https://renderhjs.net/shoebox/) for extraction (you'll need [adobe air](https://airsdk.harman.com/runtime) for install)
* used my [texturepacker](https://github.com/cgmatter/textures/blob/main/TexturePacker_V3.zip) tool for throwing it all together

Hope you get some good use out of this (and i hope i will too - although just throwing these together is actually quite satisfying)

if you want to support in any way you can do that [here](https://wwww.patreon.com/cg_matter)
